The release blog post will be updated later this beta week to better
connect to all of this.

**What to explore during beta already?**

So, what to explore? There is a new menu to be found in the system settings:
**Voice assistants**, which you should check out, [Assist](/docs/assist) is
getting ears and a voice :)

## Control what is exposed to your voice assistants

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshots/clips

{% enddetails %}

There a whole new panel, where you can control which entities are exposed
to your voice assistant. You can find it in
**Settings** > **Voice assistants** > **Expose**-tab.

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.
</p>

This currently supports our [Assist](/docs/assist), Amazon Alexa and
Google Assistant. For the latter two, it is curently limited to
the ones set up via Home Assistant Cloud.

## Local TTS/SST options

A new integration [Wyoming](/integrations/wyoming) provides a way
for Home Assistant to integrate with voice Text-to-speech and
Speech-to-text services that use the Wyoming protocol.

This release introduces two new add-ons that support this and thus provide
a fully local option (that can be used on, for example, a Raspberry Pi 4).

- Speech-to-text using [OpenAI Whisper](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=whisper).
- Text-to-speech using [Piper](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_piper).

Piper is really amazing, it is small, sounds reasonably good and
above all is fully local. [Checkout out some output examples here](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/).

## New Assist Pipeline and Language selectors

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Add screenshot?
- Link to docs (missing at this point)

{% enddetails %}

If you are building automation or scripts Blueprints, you can now leverage
two new UI selectors for use with your Blueprints: an Assist pipeline selector
and a language selectors.

## Webhooks

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

Webhooks have been extended this release. We now have support for webhooks
that use the `GET` HTTP method!

But that is not all, thanks to [@esev], we also have some new security related
features to our webhook triggers. You can now set which HTTP methods you
webhook trigger work with, and the ability to limit webhooks to work only on
your local network.

Temporary screenshot that needs to be replaced.

## Configure the LEDs of your Home Assistant Yellow

{% details "TODO" %}

- Improve/extend story
- Proof read/spelling/grammar
- Replace screenshot

{% enddetails %}

You can now configure (turn on/off) the disk, heartbeat and power LEDs of
your [Home Assistant Yellow](/yellow) by using the **Configure\* button
on the **Settings** > **Hardware\*\* page.

## Breaking Changes

{% details "TODO" %}

- Proof read/spelling/grammar

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 92035

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Accuweather" %}

The `ozone` sensors and the `ozone` state attribute of the weather entity showed
incorrect values and are being removed. If you use these values in your
automations or scripts, you need to update them.

([@bieniu] - [#91492]) ([documentation](/integrations/accuweather))

[@bieniu]: https://github.com/bieniu
[#91492]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91492

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Android TV" %}

The "Android TV" integration has been renamed to "Android Debug Bridge".

This rename, is because that is what it actually controlled/provided. With
the addition of the Android TV Remote integration this release; we wanted to
reduce possible confusion for the future.

Not really a breaking change, but here for completeness.

([@tronikos] - [#90657]) ([documentation](/integrations/androidtv))

[@tronikos]: https://github.com/tronikos
[#90657]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90657

{% enddetails %}

{% details "History" %}

YAML configuration for history has been removed as it was no longer being used
since the frontend.

([@bdraco] - [#90992]) ([documentation](/integrations/history))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#90992]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90992

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

The min/max target humidities for (de)humidifier device exposed over HomeKit
has changed. The HomeKit UI will now show the real relative humidity, when
the slider in HomeKit goes above or below the max/min set humidity, it will
be set back to the max/min allowed humidity.

([@stackia] - [#90854]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@stackia]: https://github.com/stackia
[#90854]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90854

---

Default HomeKit to listen on all interfaces to match Home Assistant behavior. To limit HomeKit to specific network interfaces, specify an `address` in `configuration.yaml`.

([@bdraco] - [#91520]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#91520]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91520

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Reolink" %}

For Reolink doorbells, the "Status LED" light entity is replaced by a
"Status LED" select entity. The switch `off` state corresponds to the select
`Auto`, and the swith `on` state corresponds to the select
`Auto & always on at night`. A additional `Stay off` state is now available.

([@starkillerOG] - [#90469]) ([documentation](/integrations/reolink))

[@starkillerOG]: https://github.com/starkillerOG
[#90469]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90469

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Snapcast" %}

- Muted groups with playing stream will have state `idle` instead of `playing`.
- Connected clients will not have state `on` anymore but use the same states as
  groups: `idle` and `playing`.
- Disconnected clients have state `standby` instead of `off` because the
  Snapcast server still accepts commands.

([@luar123] - [#77449]) ([documentation](/integrations/snapcast))

[@luar123]: https://github.com/luar123
[#77449]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/77449

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Synology DSM" %}

The unit conversion for all memory, storage, and network utilization-related
sensors was corrected from binary (_1024_) to decimal (_1000_) base to be in
line with the used measurement units (_eq. MB = 1.000.000 bytes_).

You may need to update the historically recorded units for these sensors via
the statistics page under developer tools.

([@mib1185] - [#90633]) ([documentation](/integrations/synology_dsm))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#90633]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90633

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

The `ensure_ascii` argument for `to_json` in Jinja templates now defaults to
`False`, allowing us to use a faster JSON encoder by default.

For most, this should not be an issue as JSON parsers broadly accept unicode
input. If you still need to encode unicode characters inside of JSON strings,
set `ensure_ascii` to `True` explicitly to restore the old behavior.

([@depoll] - [#91253])

[@depoll]: https://github.com/depoll
[#91253]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90863

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Network" %}

UniFi integration no longer provides both `hostname` and `host_name` attributes
for a client tracker entity, only `host_name` will be provided as an attribute.

([@Kane610] - [#91188]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifi))

[@Kane610]: https://github.com/Kane610
[#91188]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91188

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UniFi Protect" %}

The previous deprecated `set_doorbell_message` service has been removed. Use
the text entity for UniFi Protect LCD screen instead.

([@AngellusMortis] - [#91523]) ([documentation](/integrations/unifiprotect))

[@AngellusMortis]: https://github.com/AngellusMortis
[#91523]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91523

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Universal Devices ISY/IoX" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the Universal Devices ISY/IoX
integration has been removed.

Universal Devices ISY/IoX is now configured via the UI. Any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@shbatm] - [#91575]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#91575]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91575

---

The built-in percentage unit `%` is now used for relative humidity and absolute
humidity instead of the custom units `%RH` and `%AH`, respectively.

([@shbatm] - [#90863]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#90863]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/90863

---

The following custom ISY994 services have been removed:

- `reload`
- `cleanup_entities`
- `system_query`
- `set_ramp_rate`
- `set_on_level`
- `run_network_resource`
- `set_variable`

These services had been previously deprecated in favor of built-in services,
and `number`, `select`, and `button` entities. If you have not already, please
update your automations and dashboards to use the new entities and/or built-in
services.

([@shbatm] - [#91569]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#91569]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/91569

---

Dusk/Dawn nodes on Insteon Motion Sensors now have their states inverted to
correctly show "Light detected" during daylight and "No light" when the dusk
sensor is active.

This is reversed from previous behavior and if you rely on this sensor in your
automations, they will need to be updated.

([@shbatm] - [#92035]) ([documentation](/integrations/isy994))

[@shbatm]: https://github.com/shbatm
[#92035]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/92035

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Webhooks" %}

Two new Webhook trigger options have been added that limit how a webhook can
trigger an automation. A new _allowed_methods_ option can be used to control
which HTTP request methods can activate the trigger (`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, and
`PUT`). And the `local_only` option is used to allow devices outside your local
network to activate the trigger.

Previously all webhook triggers could be activated by `HEAD`, `POST`, and `PUT`
methods from any device (local or on the internet). With the new options, only
`POST` and `PUT` are enabled by default.

In Home Assistant Core 2023.7 any webhook trigger that does not set `local_only`
to false can only be activated by devices on the same network as Home Assistant.

Click the gear/cog icon beside the Webhook ID to update your webhook triggers.
Then select an appropriate value for **Only accessible from the local network**.
It is necessary to deselect the option for the **Save** button to appear. Then
reselect the option if it should be enabled. This will make the repair warning
go away.

![Screenshot 2022-09-14 10 19 56 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/289218/190221194-c18f9ec8-5847-4358-aa69-eaf81f5518d1.png)

See the [webhook trigger documentation](/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger)
for a description of the new options. And please review the new the
[Webhook Security](/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-security) section for best
practices when using webhook triggers.
