   * If the phrase does not work, try a variant. For example, if *Turn off the light* doesn't work, try: *Turn off the lights in the kitchen*.
   * Check if your phrase is [supported](/docs/assist/builtin_sentences/).
   * Make sure you are using the name of the area as it is defined in Home Assistant. If you have a room called *bathroom*, the phrase *Turning on the lights in the bath* wonâ€™t work.
